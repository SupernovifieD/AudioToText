# Extract Text from Audio File
It's a set of python scripts that working together, gives you a transcribed text file. Pretty much useful for students, or anyone who wants to extract text from an mp3 or wav file.

## Requirements
- `pydub`
- `speech_recognition`

## Instructions
Download the code to your local machine. Unpack the file. Open your terminal/shell. Navigate to the folder by typing the following in your terminal:

`cd /example/AudioToText`

Then install the required packages using pip as follow:

`pip3 install SpeechRecognition pydub`

And finally, run the `audio_text.py` file in your terminal like below:

`python audio_text.py`

It will ask for the audio file path. Copy and paste it here. Bingo, now you have a file on your desktop named `Extracted Text.txt` that contains the text you were looking for. Enjoy!
